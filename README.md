This is just an Intro to Python project. Made using Turtle Library in Python

## About Turtle Library

**Turtle graphics** is a popular way for introducing programming to kids. It was part of the original Logo programming language developed by Wally Feurzig and Seymour Papert in 1966. “Turtle” is a Python feature like a drawing board, which lets us command a turtle to draw all over it! We can use functions like turtle.forward(…) and turtle.right(…) which can move the turtle around. The turtle module provides turtle graphics primitives, in both object-oriented and procedure-oriented ways. Because it uses `tkinter` for the underlying graphics, it needs a version of Python installed with Tk support. It just works like a paint app and is efficient and very easy to use.

**Some of the animations created in Turltle library are shown below:**
